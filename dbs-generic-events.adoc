*Parameters*::
*cfCodeName* (STRING): Name of the original DBS cluster fault code.
*cfCode* (INT): DBS cluster fault code number.
*cfSeverity* (INT): Severity of the original DBS cluster fault. This is different than the EMS severity.
*serviceID* (INT): Service ID that identifies the associated cluster service. It will be "0" if there is no associated service.
*nodeID* (INT): Node ID number of the associated node. It will be "0" if there is no associated node.
*cfDriveIDs* (STRING): List of the drive IDs associated with the fault. The list might be empty.
*cfType* (STRING): DBS cluster fault type of the associated object.
*cfID* (INT): DBS cluster fault ID number associated with the fault.
*cfStatus* (INT): Current status of the cluster fault. 1 = New (just reported), 2 = Existing (updated), 3 = Resolved (closed).
